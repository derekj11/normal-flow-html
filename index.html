          <h2>The Dataviz Project</h2>
          <p>For my <em>dataviz project</em> I tracked the type of playlist I listened to
          on Spotify. The three families of playlists I tracked were: <b>Daily Mixes</b> -
          which were generated to match my preferences; <b>Artist Radios</b> - which were
          collections of music similar to selected artists; and <b>Specifically Selected</b>
          - which were songs I selected individually outside of any playlist. In
          addition to tracking the type of playlistm I also recorded how much attention
          I was giving to the music on a scale from 1 to 5, and how many songs I skipped.</p>

          <h2>The Explained Video Project</h2>
          <p>In my <em>Explained Video project</em>, my team explored possible breaches
          of ethics with regards to the use of <b>cryptocurrencies</b>. While there are
          some desirable attributes of <b>CC</b> use - such as an immutable record of transactions
          and confidentiality - they can be exploited for nefarious purposes. Many
          governments are in the process of deciding how they will regulate <b>CC</b>'s.</p>
